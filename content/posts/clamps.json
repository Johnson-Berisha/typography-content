  "body": "Why it improves UI\n\n*   Prevents tiny text on phones, massive text on ultrawides\n    \n*   Removes most media queries\n    \n*   Keeps visual hierarchy consistent\n    \n*   Very easily responsive, without the need of @media queries\n    \n    The way to use clamps is like this:\n    \n    ```\n    font-size: clamp(min, preferred, max);\n    ```\n    \n    Replace min, preferred and max with what values work for your website and boom!"
