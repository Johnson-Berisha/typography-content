  "body": "*   Contrast helps readability\n    \n*   Also helps in Hierarchy\n    \n*   It guides attention without extra noise.\n    \n\nOverusing bright or saturated colors for body text reduces comfort and focus. Good typography uses color to guide the eye, not distract it.\n\n```\n:root {\n  --bg: #0b0b0c;\n  --text: #eaeaf0;\n  --muted: #8b8b94;\n  --accent: #ff6f61;\n}\n```\n\nThis is the most simple way of having contrast in a website, we have more detailed contrast Snippets in the Code Snippets app!"
